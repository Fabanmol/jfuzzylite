### <a name="building">Building from Source</a>
Building from source requires you to have either Ant or Maven installed.

#### Ant
```bash
$ ant -f build.xml
```

The Ant script will create the library `bin/jfuzzylite.jar` and the library sources `bin/jfuzzylite-src.jar`.

#### Maven
```bash
$ mvn install
```

The Maven script will create the library `target/jfuzzylite-5.0.jar` and library sources `target/jfuzzylite-5.0-sources.jar`.


### <a name="binaries">Binaries</a>

Besides the library, the binaries contain the FuzzyLite Console application. The application can be executed using the following command.

```bash
$ java -jar jfuzzylite.jar
```

In addition, the new FuzzyLite Interactive Console is activated when exporting to `fld` without providing an output file. The interactive console allows you to evaluate controllers manually providing the input values.
